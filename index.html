                <p> Cheek 2 Cheek was established in July 2015 by myself, Jessica Okwuonu. <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> <br> At first the aim was to change the world and make everyone smile but it became very clear, very quickly that this was TOO BIG of an idea. So we started doing smaller things, trying to make the students and staff at De Monfort University feel special about themselves and happy to be a part of our amazing university. In the future we hope to do a bit more! ... <br>This page is currently under construction and will be updated soon!<br> For now enjoy what we have so far.<br> Have a good and happy day!<br>

            <p> Did you know Walt Disney was fired by a newspaper editior because they said <br><strong><underline>"he lacked imagination and had no good ideas?</strong></underline> <br> Well .... I do not need to tell you what happened. But the lesson here is, when you fail .. try, try again. <i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></p>

                <p> Above you will find a few images of what we have done so far this year. During Jessica's 3rd year she was a frontrunner at DMU Square Mile and did some additional volunteering for them (you will find these images here). She also built a robot and took it into schools on behalf of DMU Square Mile in order to teach them about robotics.  </p>

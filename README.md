I decided to design a website about my university volunteering group; Cheek to Cheek. As you can see there are hardly any commits, this is because I did not know how to use GitHub (still not sure, but I got this working so - hey! :) ) 


At first I wanted to do a 5 page website with loading buttons. I created a loading button which loaded to 100% and then switched to the next page. I was then looking at other websites and I found a one page website that i really liked and also found the youtube tutorial (XO Pixel)  and follow it to create my one page website. 

From then I wanted to learn more so I started watching more and more tutorials:
Adam Lerner
Mir Rom
Dev Tips etc 

I also started looking up different types of java turtoials I could use to make my one page portfolio look more intresting. I tried to created a heart falling button that upon click the hearts started to fall down from the top of the page but it did not work. 

If I had better html/java skills I would like to create scrolling animation and background animations like pirateco looks like. Also create a canvas that allows the visitor of the website to draw on the page.

I decided to design a website about my university volunteering group; Cheek to Cheek. As you can see there are hardly any commits, this is because I did not know how to use GitHub (still not sure, but I got this working so - hey! :) ) 

At first I wanted to do a 5 page website with loading buttons. I created a loading button which loaded to 100% and then switched to the next page. I was then looking at other websites and I found a one page website that i really liked and also found the youtube tutorial (XO Pixel)  and follow it to create my one page website. 

From then I wanted to learn more so I started watching more and more tutorials on youtube:
Adam Lerner
Mir Rom
Dev Tips etc Alot of what I learnt from these youtubers where very helpful and if I was to continue on with front end development I would incoprate it into my work. Although due to the nature of my website I did not believe that trying to 'pack' out my website with a whole bunch of gif's and java animation would demonstrate my ability but show that I learnt nothing from previous coursework about what a good website looks like.  

I also started looking up different types of java turtoials I could use to make my one page portfolio look more intresting. I tried to created a heart falling button that upon click the hearts started to fall down from the top of the page but it did not work. 

If I had better html/java skills I would like to create scrolling animation and background animations like pirateco looks like. Also create a canvas that allows the visitor of the website to draw on the page. 

I enjoyed creating this website, W3 schools also helped alot with the creation of this work and helped boost my creativity and confidence in what I am able to produce. It reminded me of things I thought I never knew.

Thank you and I hope you enjoy my work.
